Description: Identifying cell types based on expression profiles is a pillar of single cell analysis. scROSHI identifies cell types based on expression profiles of single cellanalysis by utilizing previously obtained cell type specific gene sets. It takes into accountthe hierarchical nature of cell type relationship and does not require training or annotated data.
